                            <h3>Reverend Johnson Wambua</h3>
                            <p>
                                The founder, Reverend Johnson Wambua is an ordained minister of the Gospel and serves as the Pastor In-charge of AIC Zion church in Mathare slums, Nairobi Kenya. Growing up back in kathonzweni of Makueni County, the seed of evangelism would germinate very early in his life when he served in his home church in the twin roles of a Sunday school teacher and youth leader. Coming from an arid and semi-arid area characterized by deprivation and drought, he would be moved by the struggle for livelihood encountered by his community. It’s these dire experiences which would inform his resolve to endeavor to seek for solutions to the challenges faced by his community. 
                                The chapter on his early life would not be complete without mention of his intervals of stay at Lake Magadi where he would occasionally visit his father who used to work as a truck driver. From these occasional visits, Rev. Wambua would deeply connect with the Masai community after picking interest in their culture and traditions (pastoralism, nomadic way of life, female circumcision and marriage of under-age girls). On the flip-side, the community’s Commitment to this culture has resulted to their marginalization as result of low learner enrolment in schools as young boys are turned into herders and girls offered by their parents into early marriage after undergoing female genital mutilation (FGM). 
                                It’s this experience with the Masai community which would consolidate his earlier resolve to dedicate his life to work towards aligning marginalized communities on the pathway to adopt Christianity, education and civilized ways of life. And when the calling to the higher purpose became irresistible, he would leave his well-paid job with the National Social security protection fund to enroll for training in theology which culminated into his ordination and appointment as a pastor in various Districts of the African Inland Church. And as fate would have it, Rev.Johnson Wambua was posted to serve as a pastor at AIC ZION within the populous and crime infested Mathare slums in Nairobi, Kenya. Here he came face-to-face to deplorable living conditions for families living in the second largest slum in Kenya. 
                                To take his calling to the homestretch and based on the earlier convictions, the SPRINGS OF HOPE for COMMUNITIES (SHOFCOM) (SHOFCOM) whose long term objective is to transform the lives of the Masai’s and slum families was borne.

                                    And who is my neighbor?” The teacher of the law decided to test Jesus. In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was
                                    attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away,
                                    leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when
                                    he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.So too, a Levite, when he came to
                                    the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.But a Samaritan, as he
                                    traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He
                                    went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on
                                    his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took
                                    out two denarii[c] and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and
                                    when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’
                                    “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the
                                    hands of robbers?”
                                    The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.”
                                    Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”
